From SMARD Manual:
The actual consumption on the SMARD website corresponds to the total load (including
network losses without stored energy). This is the net generation minus export transmission
capacity, plus import transmission capacity and minus the feed-in capacity from hydro
pumped storage power stations.

==> Adjust for PHS only, imports/exports are already included
